# 🚀 TurboTux Blog - Because Regular Blogs Are Too Mainstream

> A blazingly fast, markdown-powered blog engine that makes WordPress look like it's running on a potato.

## 🌟 Features That Will Blow Your Mind

- ✍️ **Markdown Support** - Because raw HTML is so 1990s
- 🎨 **Syntax Highlighting** - Makes your code look prettier than your profile picture
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Looks great on everything from a smartwatch to a smart fridge
- 🚄 **Blazingly Fast™** - Loading times so quick, you'll think it's cached (it probably is)
- 🔍 **SEO Friendly** - Google will love your blog more than your mom does

## 🛠️ Tech Stack of Dreams

- Django - Because we're not savages
- Python - The language that speaks parseltongue
- Markdown - Making text fancy since 2004
- Nginx - The server that serves
- Gunicorn - The mythical creature that runs your Django
- Cloudflare - Because we don't trust the internet

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this bad boy:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MichalPolach/DjangoBlog.git
cd DjangoBlog
```

2. Set up your virtual environment (because we're responsible developers):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run migrations (because Django loves databases):
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create a superuser (with great power comes great responsibility):
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Run the server and feel the power:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

7. Visit `http://localhost:8000` and bask in the glory of your new blog!

## 🎨 Customization

Want to make it your own? Go wild! Here are some things you can do:

## 📝 Writing Posts

1. Log into the admin panel (like a boss)
2. Click "Add Post" (revolutionary, I know)
3. Write something amazing (or at least try)
4. Hit publish (and pray for likes)

## 🚨 Common Issues
